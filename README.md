# ShaderGraphDemo
Demo scene for Shader Graph talk based on John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt Project
(Link to the base project on Unity Learn https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner)


In this demo, the project has been migrated from built-in Render Pipeline to Universal Render Pipeline as Shader Graph can on be used with SRP.

List of Shaders shown in the demo:
-Customize the main character color (John Lemon).
-Ghost effect.
-Shake effect on the carpets and the frames (Using Sub Graph for both).
-Glow effect on the Frames.

The demo also features the use of a custom function and modifying the properties from C# script.
